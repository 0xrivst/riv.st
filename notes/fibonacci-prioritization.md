The idea of Fibonacci prioritization is to have several "buckets", each with a "capacity" corresponding to the number in the Fibonacci sequence. The priority of tasks in the bucket decreases with each next level.

Thus, level 1 holds a single, overarching task—something really important or meaningful, something you can't (or shouldn't) sacrifice. Level 2 holds two tasks, roughly of the same importance; this assumes they can compete with each other. Level 3 holds three tasks and so on. I cap priorities at level 5—by this moment you already have 11 tasks to work with. I feel like any more will cause analysis paralysis.

Fibonacci prioritization can be used for any items that need to be prioritized but I find it working more naturally for larger-scale goals, like learning a language.

A good exercise is making a table like this for each level.

### Level N

| What?            | How?                              | Why?                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| What is the goal | - How are you going to achieve it | - Why is it important  |
|                  | - Do this                         | - I want to move to... |
|                  | - Do that                         | - It will help me...   |

By filling all levels, you get a map of you 11 main goals/priorities right now, quick outline of how to work towards them and a reminder why they are important.
